//There is a special square room with mirrors on each of the
// four walls. Except for the southwest corner, there are
// receptors on each of the remaining corners, numbered 0, 1, and 2.
//
//The square room has walls of length p and a laser ray from the southwest
// corner first meets the east wall at a distance q from the 0th receptor.
//
//Given the two integers p and q, return the number of the receptor that the ray meets first.
//
//The test cases are guaranteed so that the ray will meet a receptor eventually.
