//There are n workers. You are given two integer arrays quality and
// wage where quality[i] is the quality of the ith worker and
// wage[i] is the minimum wage expectation for the ith worker.
//
//We want to hire exactly k workers to form a paid group.
// To hire a group of k workers, we must pay them according to the following rules:
//
//Every worker in the paid group must be paid at least their minimum wage expectation.
//In the group, each worker's pay must be directly proportional to their quality.
// This means if a workerâ€™s quality is double that of another worker in the group,
// then they must be paid twice as much as the other worker.
//Given the integer k, return the least amount of money needed to form a paid group
// satisfying the above conditions. Answers within 10-5 of the actual answer will be accepted.
